The overall architecture needs to be consistent to avoid duplicate work in the Roadmap.\nProposal should be discussed at Community meeting Community Meeting agenda to be presented to maintainers and contributors.\nWhen reviewed and approved it can be implemented either by the original submitter or anyone else from the community which we highly encourage, as the project is community driven. Open PRs in the respective repositories with all the necessary code and test changes as described in the current document.\nOnce implemented or during the implementation, the PRs are reviewed by maintainers and contributors, following the best practices and methods.\nAfter merging the new PRs, the proposal must be moved to community/proposals and marked as done!\nYou have made Harbor even better, congratulations.
