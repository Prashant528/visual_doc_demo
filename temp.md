Develop and propose new features.
The following simple process can be used to submit new features or changes to the existing code.
See if your feature is already being worked on. Check both the Issues and the PRs in the main Harbor repository as well as the Community repository.
Submit(open PR) the new proposal at community/proposals/new using the already existing template
The proposal must be labeled as "kind/proposal" - check examples here
The proposal can be modified and adapted to meet the requirements from the community, other maintainers and contributors. The overall architecture needs to be consistent to avoid duplicate work in the Roadmap.
Proposal should be discussed at Community meeting Community Meeting agenda to be presented to maintainers and contributors.
When reviewed and approved it can be implemented either by the original submitter or anyone else from the community which we highly encourage, as the project is community driven. Open PRs in the respective repositories with all the necessary code and test changes as described in the current document.
Once implemented or during the implementation, the PRs are reviewed by maintainers and contributors, following the best practices and methods.
After merging the new PRs, the proposal must be moved to community/proposals and marked as done!
You have made Harbor even better, congratulations. Thank you!
