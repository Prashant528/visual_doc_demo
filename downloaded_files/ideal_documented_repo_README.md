# Adding a new model

This page has been updated in light of the removal of the `add_new_model` script in favor of the more complete 
`add_new_model_like` script.

We recommend you checkout the documentation of [How to add a model](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/add_new_model)
in the Hugging Face Transformers documentation for complete and up-to-date instructions.
