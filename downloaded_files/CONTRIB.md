<!-- when editing this file also update https://github.com/flutter/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md -->\n\nContributing to Flutter\n=======================\n\n_tl;dr: join [Discord](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Chat), be [courteous](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), follow the steps below to set up a development environment; if you stick around and contribute, you can [join the team](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Contributor-access) and get commit access._\n\nWelcome\n-------\n\nWe invite you to join the Flutter team, which is made up of volunteers and sponsored folk alike!\nThere are many ways to contribute, including writing code, filing issues on GitHub, helping people\non our mailing lists, our chat channels, or on Stack Overflow, helping to triage, reproduce, or\nfix bugs that people have filed, adding to our documentation,\ndoing outreach about Flutter, or helping out in any other way.\n\nWe grant commit access (which includes full rights to the issue\ndatabase, such as being able to edit labels) to people who have gained\nour trust and demonstrated a commitment to Flutter. For more details\nsee the [Contributor access](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Contributor-access)\npage on our wiki.\n\nWe communicate primarily over GitHub and [Discord](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Chat).\n\nBefore you get started, we encourage you to read these documents which describe some of our community norms:\n\n1. [Our code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which stipulates explicitly\n   that everyone must be gracious, respectful, and professional. This\n   also documents our conflict resolution policy and encourages people\n   to ask questions.\n\n2. [Values](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Values),\n   which talks about what we care most about.\n\nHelping out in the issue database\n---------------------------------\n\nTriage is the process of going through bug reports and determining if they are valid, finding out\nhow to reproduce them, catching duplicate reports, and generally making our issues list\nuseful for our engineers.\n\nIf you want to help us triage, you are very welcome to do so!\n\n1. Join the #hackers-triage [Discord channel](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Chat).\n\n2. Read [our code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which stipulates explicitly\n   that everyone must be gracious, respectful, and professional. If you\'re helping out\n   with triage, you are representing the Flutter team, and so you want to make sure to\n   make a good impression!\n\n3. Help out as described in our wiki: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Triage\n   You won\'t be able to add labels at first, so instead start by trying to\n   do the other steps, e.g. trying to reproduce the problem and asking for people to\n   provide enough details that you can reproduce the problem, pointing out duplicates,\n   and so on. Chat on the #hackers-triage channel to let us know what you\'re up to!\n\n4. Familiarize yourself with our\n   [issue hygiene](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Issue-hygiene) wiki page,\n   which covers the meanings of some important GitHub labels and\n   milestones.\n\n5. Once you\'ve been doing this for a while, someone will invite you to the flutter-hackers\n   team on GitHub and you\'ll be able to add labels too. See the\n   [contributor access](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Contributor-access) wiki\n   page for details.\n\n\nQuality Assurance\n-----------------\n\nOne of the most useful tasks, closely related to triage, is finding and filing bug reports. Testing\nbeta releases, looking for regressions, creating test cases, adding to our test suites, and\nother work along these lines can really drive the quality of the product up. Creating tests\nthat increase our test coverage, writing tests for issues others have filed, all these tasks\nare really valuable contributions to open source projects.\n\nIf this interests you, you can jump in and submit bug reports without needing anyone\'s permission!\nThe #quality-assurance channel on our [Discord server](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Chat)\nis a good place to talk about what you\'re doing. We\'re especially eager for QA testing when\nwe announce a beta release. See https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Quality-Assurance for\nmore details.\n\nIf you want to contribute test cases, you can also submit PRs. See the next section\nfor how to set up your development environment, or ask in #hackers-test on Discord.\n\n> As a personal side note, this is exactly the kind of work that first got me into open\n> source. I was a Quality Assurance volunteer on the Mozilla project, writing test cases for\n> browsers, long before I wrote a line of code for any open source project. \xe2\x80\x94Hixie\n\n\nDeveloping for Flutter\n----------------------\n\nIf you would prefer to write code, you may wish to start with our list of good first issues for [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or for [Flutter DevTools](https://github.com/flutter/devtools/labels/good%20first%20issue). See the respective sections below for further instructions.\n\n### Framework and Engine\n\nTo develop for Flutter, you will eventually need to become familiar\nwith our processes and conventions. This section lists the documents\nthat describe these methodologies. The following list is ordered: you\nare strongly recommended to go through these documents in the order\npresented.\n\n1. [Setting up your engine development environment](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Setting-up-the-Engine-development-environment),\n   which describes the steps you need to configure your computer to\n   work on Flutter\'s engine. If you only want to write code for the\n   Flutter framework, you can skip this step. Flutter\'s engine mainly\n   uses C++, Java, and Objective-C.\n\n2. [Setting up your framework development environment](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Setting-up-the-Framework-development-environment),\n   which describes the steps you need to configure your computer to\n   work on Flutter\'s framework. Flutter\'s framework mainly uses Dart.\n\n3. [Tree hygiene](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene),\n   which covers how to land a PR, how to do code review, how to\n   handle breaking changes, how to handle regressions, and how to\n   handle post-commit test failures.\n\n4. [Our style guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo),\n   which includes advice for designing APIs for Flutter, and how to\n   format code in the framework.\n\n5. [Flutter design doc template](https://flutter.dev/go/template),\n   which should be used when proposing a new technical design.  This is a good\n   practice to do before coding more intricate changes.\n   See also our [guidance for writing design docs](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Design-Documents).\n\n[![How to contribute to Flutter](https://img.youtube.com/vi/4yBgOBAOx_A/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBgOBAOx_A)\n\nIn addition to the documents, there is a video linked above on **How to contribute to Flutter**\nfrom the [Flutter](https://youtube.com/c/flutterdev) YouTube channel,\nthere are many pages on [our Wiki](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/),\nand an article [Contributing to Flutter: Getting Started](https://medium.com/@ayushbherwani/contributing-to-flutter-getting-started-a0db68cbcd5b)\non Medium that may be of interest. For a curated list of pages see the sidebar\non the wiki\'s home page. They are more or less listed in order of importance.\n\n### DevTools\n\nContributing code to Dart & Flutter DevTools may be a good place to start if you are\nlooking to dip your toes into contributing with a relatively low-cost setup or if you\nare generally excited about improving the Dart & Flutter developer experience.\n\nPlease see the DevTools [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/flutter/devtools/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\nguide to get started.\n\nOutreach\n--------\n\nIf your interests lie in the direction of developer relations and developer outreach,\nwhether advocating for Flutter, answering questions in fora like\n[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/flutter?sort=Newest&filters=NoAnswers,NoAcceptedAnswer&edited=true)\nor [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/flutterhelp/new/?f=flair_name%3A%22OPEN%22),\nor creating content for our [documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/)\nor sites like [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=flutter&sp=EgQIAxAB),\nthe best starting point is to join the #hackers-devrel [Discord channel](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Chat).\nFrom there, you can describe what you\'re interested in doing, and go ahead and do it!\nAs others become familiar with your work, they may have feedback, be interested in\ncollaborating, or want to coordinate their efforts with yours.\n\n\nAPI documentation\n-----------------\n\nAnother great area to contribute in is sample code and API documentation. If this is an area that interests you, join our\n[Discord](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Chat) server and introduce yourself on the #hackers-deverl, #hackers-framework,\nor #hackers-engine channels, describing your area of interest. As our API docs are integrated into our source code, see the\n"developing for Flutter" section above for a guide on how to set up your developer environment.\n\nTo contribute API documentation, an excellent command of the English language is particularly helpful, as is a careful attention to detail.\nWe have a [whole section in our style guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo#documentation-dartdocs-javadocs-etc)\nthat you should read before you write API documentation. It includes notes on the "Flutter Voice", such as our word and grammar conventions.\n\nIn general, a really productive way to improve documentation is to use Flutter and stop any time you have a question: find the answer, then\ndocument the answer where you first looked for it.\n\nWe also keep [a list of areas that need better API documentation](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22d%3A+api+docs%22+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc).\nIn many cases, we have written down what needs to be said in the relevant issue, we just haven\'t gotten around to doing it!\n\nWe\'re especially eager to add sample code and diagrams to our API documentation. Diagrams are generated from Flutter code that\ndraws to a canvas, and stored in a [special repository](https://github.com/flutter/assets-for-api-docs/#readme). It can be a lot of fun\nto create new diagrams for the API docs.\n\n\nReleases\n--------\n\nIf you are interested in participating in our release process, which may involve writing release notes and blog posts, coordinating the actual\ngeneration of binaries, updating our release tooling, and other work of that nature, then reach out on the #hackers-releases\nchannel of our [Discord](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Chat) server.\n\n\nSocial events in the contributor community\n------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, one area where you could have a lot of impact is in contributing to social interactions among the Flutter contributor community itself.\nThis could take the form of organizing weekly video chats on our Discord, or planning tech talks from contributors, for example.\nIf this is an area that is of interest to you, please join our [Discord](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Chat) and ping Hixie on the #hackers\nchannel!\n
