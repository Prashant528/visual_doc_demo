See the\ncontributor access wiki\npage for details.", 'Quality Assurance', 'One of the most useful tasks, closely related to triage, is finding and filing bug reports. Testing\nbeta releases, looking for regressions, creating test cases, adding to our test suites, and\nother work along these lines can really drive the quality of the product up. Creating tests\nthat increase our test coverage, writing tests for issues others have filed, all these tasks\nare really valuable contributions to open source projects.', "If this interests you, you can jump in and submit bug reports without needing anyone's permission!\nThe #quality-assurance channel on our Discord server\nis a good place to talk about what you're doing. We're especially eager for QA testing when\nwe announce a beta release. See https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Quality-Assurance for\nmore details.", 'If you want to contribute test cases, you can also submit PRs. See the next section\nfor how to set up your development environment, or ask in #hackers-test on Discord.', 'As a personal side note, this is exactly the kind of work that first got me into open\nsource.
