Contributing to Flutter
 
 tl;dr: join Discord, be courteous, follow the steps below to set up a development environment; if you stick around and contribute, you can join the team and get commit access.
Welcome
 
 We invite you to join the Flutter team, which is made up of volunteers and sponsored folk alike!
There are many ways to contribute, including writing code, filing issues on GitHub, helping people
 on our mailing lists, our chat channels, or on Stack Overflow, helping to triage, reproduce, or
 fix bugs that people have filed, adding to our documentation,
 doing outreach about Flutter, or helping out in any other way.
We grant commit access (which includes full rights to the issue
 database, such as being able to edit labels) to people who have gained
 our trust and demonstrated a commitment to Flutter.
For more details
 see the Contributor access
 page in our docs.
We communicate primarily over GitHub and Discord.
Before you get started, we encourage you to read these documents which describe some of our community norms:
 
 1.
Our code of conduct, which stipulates explicitly
     that everyone must be gracious, respectful, and professional.
This
     also documents our conflict resolution policy and encourages people

to ask questions.

Helping out in the issue database
 
 Triage is the process of going through bug reports and determining if they are valid, finding out

how to reproduce them, catching duplicate reports, and generally making our issues list
 useful for our engineers.
If you want to help us triage, you are very welcome to do so!

2.
Read our code of conduct, which stipulates explicitly
     that everyone must be gracious, respectful, and professional.
If you're helping out
     with triage, you are representing the Flutter team, and so you want to make sure to
     make a good impression!
3.
Help out as described in our triage guide
     You won't be able to add labels at first, so instead start by trying to
     do the other steps, e.g.
trying to reproduce the problem and asking for people to
     provide enough details that you can reproduce the problem, pointing out duplicates,
     and so on.
Chat on the #hackers-triage channel to let us know what you're up to!
4.
Familiarize yourself with our
     issue hygiene wiki page,
     which covers the meanings of some important GitHub labels and
     milestones.
5.
Once you've been doing this for a while, someone will invite you to the flutter-hackers
     team on GitHub and you'll be able to add labels too.
See the
     contributor access wiki
     page for details.
