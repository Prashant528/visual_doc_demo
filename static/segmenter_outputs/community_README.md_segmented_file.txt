Communication
The Kubernetes community abides by the [Kubernetes code of conduct](/code-of-conduct.md) on all of the communication platforms that we moderate listed below with noted exceptions.

Here is an excerpt from the code of conduct: As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

Purpose of This Doc
A detailed list of upstream communication platforms and resources for contributors.

Since upstream contributors are generally consumers, many of our channels intertwine. See for more end user/troubleshooting targeted paths.

--------<PREDICTED_SEGMENT_BOUNDARY>--------

Community Groups
Kubernetes encompasses many projects, organized into [community groups](/governance.md#community-groups). Upstream communication flows through those channels, most notably in the Special Interest Groups [SIGs](/sig-list.md) that own the docs and codebases. Their communication channels may include mailing lists, slack channels, zoom meetings, meeting agenda/notes, and can be found on their READMEs and on the community groups/[SIGs](/sig-list.md) page.

You can actively or passively participate in one of the following ways:
- The community group's public meeting(s) listed on the above community groups page
- Every Third Thursday at our [monthly community meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VQDIAB0OqiSjIHI8AWMvSdceWhnz56jNpZrLs6o7NJY/edit#) over [zoom](https://zoom.us/my/kubernetescommunity) at [10am US Pacific Time](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=10:00&tz=PT%20%28Pacific%20Time%29)
- Intro sessions at KubeCon/CloudNativeCon live or [recordings on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA)

Nevertheless, below find a list of many general channels, groups, and meetings devoted to the Kubernetes project. Please check the guidelines and any relevant chat/conversation history before posting. Spam and sales pitches are not tolerated on these platforms.

Appropriate Content for Community Resources
All communications properties are under the [Kubernetes code of conduct](/code-of-conduct.md). Additionally, these resources are for the contributors and users of Kubernetes; commercial usage of these properties is heavily moderated. Note that commercial content is allowed, unsolicited commercial content mostly is NOT:

Examples of inappropriate content:
- Posting unsolicited content of a commercial nature on Slack or other community forums
- Messaging people individually on a platform with content of an unsolicited commercial nature
- Unsolicited pitching of commercial products during a Kubernetes meeting

Examples of appropriate content:
- Asking about commercial products in an appropriate channel. For example most clouds have a channel in Slack, asking how to use GKE on the GKE channel or AKS on the Azure channels is fine.
- "Does anyone have experience with project foo?" is fine
- Some OSS projects are also hosted on the Kubernetes Slack that also have a commercial offering, these are allowed.

Decisions Are Made Here
The project is very large with a robust community group ecosystem and bubbling up information is important. Transparency is necessary and these channels are key:
- [kubernetes-dev](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev) mailing list - all upstream Kubernetes news and discussion. Many community groups have charters that state they have to post here for certain topics like project wide changes. Joining this mailing list is required [k-dev moderators](./moderators.md#kubernetes-dev) for GitHub [org membership](/community-membership.md) and will get you access to all community docs that are not in GitHub.
- GitHub Issues and PRs in an [associated repository](/github-management#actively-used-github-organizations) and
- KEPs[(Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals)](https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps)

We don't recommend following or watching any repository unless you are using [heavy email filters](./best-practices.md). Getting involved with the community group(s) directly is the best way to find out how to best watch what you need on GitHub.

--------<PREDICTED_SEGMENT_BOUNDARY>--------

Discussions Happen Here
We talk a lot, too.

Slack
Our real-time platform with Kubernetes enthusiasts spread across 250+ channels. Owned and operated by sig-contributor-experience. [Join](http://slack.k8s.io) | [Slack Guidelines](/communication/slack-guidelines.md) | [slack moderators](./moderators.md#slack) | [#kubernetes-contributors](https://app.slack.com/client/T09NY5SBT/C09R23FHP)

Pro-tip: If you want to add a new channel, simply file a request following [these instructions](/communication/slack-guidelines.md#requesting-a-channel).

--------<PREDICTED_SEGMENT_BOUNDARY>--------

Mailing lists and forums
Most of the Kubernetes mailing lists are hosted through Google Groups or [Discuss Kubernetes](https://discuss.kubernetes.io). These also power most of the access to our documentation and calendar items like SIG meetings. [mailing list guidelines](./mailing-list-guidelines.md) | [email filtering tips](./best-practices.md)

- [kubernetes-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-announce) broadcasts major project announcements such as releases and security issues
- [kubernetes-dev](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev) hosts contributor announcements and discussions for upstream
- [Discuss Kubernetes](https://discuss.kubernetes.io) is a forum where Kubernetes users trade notes with sections for contributors and all kinds of ecosystem related content
- Additional Google groups exist and can be joined for discussion related to each community group as noted above. These are linked from the [SIG list](/sig-list.md).

--------<PREDICTED_SEGMENT_BOUNDARY>--------

Calendar & Meetings
We use Zoom for all of our community group meetings and contributor programs. - [Zoom Guidelines](./zoom-guidelines.md)

We keep a [shared calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=calendar%40kubernetes.io) with all of our community group meetings. If you'd like a contributor event published, please reach out to [#sig-contribex](https://app.slack.com/client/T09NY5SBT/C1TU9EB9S) on slack.

Issues & Troubleshooting
For questions about installing, running, or troubleshooting Kubernetes, please start with the [troubleshooting guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/troubleshooting/). If that doesn't answer your question(s), try to post on discuss.kubernetes.io or if you think you found a bug, please [file an issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/new).

Other
- [r/kubernetes](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/) - reddit channel owned and operated by community members and not an official channel for the project.

Conferences, Meetups, Summits, and Face to Face Meetings
CNCF is the main driver for all KubeCon + CloudNativeCons, Kubernetes Forums, and the [Kubernetes Meetup Pro](https://github.com/cncf/meetups) program on meetup.com. KubeCon + CloudNativeCon, is held every spring in Europe, summer in China, and winter in North America. Information about these and other community events is available on the CNCF [events](https://www.cncf.io/events/) pages. The project also has several face to face meetings and contributor summits throughout the year. To stay updated, check the calendar, your community group of interest, and/or the #contributor-summit slack channel for more information.
