## Introduction
Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It aims to provide a "platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts".

## Getting Started
To get started with Kubernetes, you need to install the Kubernetes CLI, kubectl. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
curl -LO "https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
chmod +x ./kubectl
sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

## Setting Up a Cluster
To set up a Kubernetes cluster, you can use Minikube, which is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. Install Minikube using the following command:

```bash
curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
chmod +x minikube
sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin/
```

Start your cluster with:

```bash
minikube start
```

## Deploying Applications
Once your cluster is up and running, you can deploy applications using Kubernetes. Create a deployment using the following command:

```bash
kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.4
```

Expose your deployment:

```bash
kubectl expose deployment hello-node --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080
```

## Monitoring and Logging
Kubernetes provides built-in tools for monitoring and logging. You can use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring, and Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK) for logging.

To install Prometheus, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/main/bundle.yaml
```

## Conclusion
Kubernetes is a powerful tool for managing containerized applications in a clustered environment. By following the steps outlined in this document, you can set up a Kubernetes cluster and deploy applications efficiently.
