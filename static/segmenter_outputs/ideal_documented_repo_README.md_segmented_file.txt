Adding a new model

--------<PREDICTED_SEGMENT_BOUNDARY>--------

This page has been updated in light of the removal of the `add_new_model` script in favor of the more complete `add_new_model_like` script. We recommend you checkout the documentation of [How to add a model](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/add_new_model) in the Hugging Face Transformers documentation for complete and up-to-date instructions.

--------<PREDICTED_SEGMENT_BOUNDARY>--------

The segmentation appears to be correct as it stands. The first segment introduces the topic of adding a new model, and the second segment provides specific information about the updated process and where to find more detailed instructions. No additional boundaries are needed, and the existing boundaries are appropriately placed to separate the introduction from the detailed instructions.
