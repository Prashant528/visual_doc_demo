This guide will help you understand the overall organization of the Kubernetes project, and direct you to the best places to get started contributing. You'll be able to pick up issues, write code to fix them, and get your work reviewed and merged. This document is the single source of truth for how to contribute to the code base. Feel free to browse the open issues and file new ones, all feedback is welcome!",

Completing these steps will make your first contribution easier: Create a GitHub account Before you get started, you will need to sign up for a GitHub user account. Sign the CLA Before you can contribute to Kubernetes, you will need to sign the Contributor License Agreement. The easiest way to do so is to open a PR against the contributor playground repo, you can find an example PR here.
