In order to avoid forcing people to be \"at work\" effectively 24/7, we want to establish some semi-formal protocols around development. Hopefully, these rules make things go more smoothly. If you find that this is not the case, please complain loudly. As a potential contributor, your changes and ideas are welcome at any hour of the day or night, weekdays, weekends, and holidays. Please do not ever hesitate to ask a question or send a pull request. Check out our [community guiding principles](/contributors/guide/expectations.md#code-review) on how to create great code as a big group. Beginner focused information can be found below in and.

That document is comprehensive and detailed, for purposes of a typical pull request we will cover the initial and simple use case here: Opening a Pull Request Pull requests are often called a \"PR\". Kubernetes generally follows the standard [github pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) process, but there is a layer of additional kubernetes specific (and sometimes SIG specific) differences: The first difference you'll see is that a bot will begin applying structured labels to your PR. The bot may also make some helpful suggestions for commands to run in your PR to facilitate review. These `/command` options can be entered in comments to trigger auto-labeling and notifications. Refer to its [command reference documentation](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands).<br />"

            "Testing": "Testing is the responsibility of all contributors and is in part owned by all SIGs, but is also coordinated by [sig-testing](/sig-testing). Refer to the [Testing Guide](/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md) for more information. There are multiple types of tests.<br />- **Unit**: These confirm that a particular function behaves as intended. Golang includes a native ability for unit testing via the [testing](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/) package. Unit test source code can be found adjacent to the corresponding source code within a given package. For example: functions defined in [kubernetes/cmd/kubeadm/app/util/version.go](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/cmd/kubeadm/app/util/version.go) will have unit tests in [kubernetes/cmd/kubeadm/app/util/version_test.go](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/cmd/kubeadm/app/util/version_test.go). These are easily run locally by any developer on any OS.<br />- **Integration**: These tests cover interactions of package components or interactions between kubernetes components and some other non-kubernetes system resource (eg: etcd). An example would be testing whether a piece of code can correctly store data to or retrieve data from etcd. Integration tests are stored in [kubernetes/test/integration/](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/test/integration). Running these can require the developer set up additional functionality on their development system.<br />- **End-to-end (\"e2e\")**: These are broad tests of overall system behavior and coherence. These are more complicated as they require a functional kubernetes cluster built from the sources to be tested. A separate [document detailing e2e testing](/contributors/devel/sig-testing/e2e-tests.md) and test cases themselves can be found in [kubernetes/test/e2e/](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/test/e2e).<br />- **Conformance**: These are a set of testcases, currently a subset of the integration/e2e tests, that the Architecture SIG has approved to define the core set of interoperable features that all Kubernetes deployments must support. For more information on Conformance tests please see the [Conformance Testing](/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/conformance-tests.md) Document. Continuous integration will run these tests either as pre-submits on PRs, post-submits against master/release branches, or both. The results appear on [testgrid](https://testgrid.k8s.io). sig-testing is responsible for that official infrastructure and CI. The associated automation is tracked in the [test-infra repo](https://git.k8s.io/test-infra). If you're looking to run e2e tests on your own infrastructure, [kubetest](https://git.k8s.io/test-infra/kubetest) is the mechanism.<br />- [Security Release Page](https://git.k8s.io/security/security-release-process.md) - outlines the procedures for the handling of security issues.<br />- [Security and Disclosure Information](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/issues-security/security/) - check this page if you wish to report a security vulnerability."
