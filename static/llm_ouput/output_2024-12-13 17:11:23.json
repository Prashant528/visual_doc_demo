In order to avoid forcing people to be \"at work\" effectively 24/7, we want to establish some semi-formal protocols around development. Hopefully, these rules make things go more smoothly. If you find that this is not the case, please complain loudly. As a potential contributor, your changes and ideas are welcome at any hour of the day or night, weekdays, weekends, and holidays. Please do not ever hesitate to ask a question or send a pull request. Check out our community guiding principles on how to create great code as a big group. Beginner focused information can be found below in Open a Pull Request and Code Review. For quick reference on contributor resources, we have a handy contributor cheatsheet.<br />",

There are two aspects of code review: giving and receiving.<br />- Reviewers are highly encouraged to revisit the Code of Conduct as well as community expectations.<br />- When reviewing PRs from others, The Gentle Art of Patch Review suggests an iterative series of focuses:<br />  - Is the idea behind the contribution sound?<br />  - Is the contribution architected correctly?<br />  - Is the contribution polished?<br />Note: if your pull request isn't getting enough attention, you can use the #pr-reviews channel on Slack to get help finding reviewers.",

Refer to the Testing Guide for more information.<br />There are multiple types of tests:<br />- Unit: These confirm that a particular function behaves as intended.<br />- Integration: These tests cover interactions of package components or interactions between Kubernetes components and some other non-Kubernetes system resource.<br />- End-to-end (\"e2e\"): These are broad tests of overall system behavior and coherence.<br />- Conformance: These are a set of test cases that the Architecture SIG has approved to define the core set of interoperable features that all Kubernetes deployments must support.<br />Continuous integration will run these tests either as pre-submits on PRs, post-submits against master/release branches, or both. The results appear on testgrid."
