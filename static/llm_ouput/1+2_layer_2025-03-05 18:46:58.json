        "Documentation Setup": "This is my documentation readme file. Generating the documentation<br />To generate the documentation, you first have to build it. Several packages are necessary to build the doc, you can install them with the following command, at the root of the code repository:<br />``` pip install -e \"[docs]\" ```<br />Then you need to install our special tool that builds the documentation:<br />``` pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/doc-builder ```",
        "Building Documentation": "Building the documentation<br />Once you have setup the `doc-builder` and additional packages, you can generate the documentation by typing the following command:<br />``` doc-builder build transformers docs/source/en/ --build_dir ~/tmp/test-build ```<br />You can adapt the `--build_dir` to set any temporary folder that you prefer. This command will create it and generate the MDX files that will be rendered as the documentation on the main website. You can inspect them in your favorite Markdown editor.",
        "Setup Environment": "Using the `cookiecutter` utility requires to have all the `dev` dependencies installed. Let's first [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the `transformers` repo on github. Once it's done you can clone your fork and install `transformers` in our environment: <br /> ``` <br /> git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/transformers <br /> cd transformers <br /> pip install -e \"[dev]\" <br /> ```",
        "Generate Template": "Once the installation is done, you can generate the template by running the following command. Be careful, the template will be generated inside a new folder in your current working directory. <br /> ``` <br /> cookiecutter path-to-the-folder/adding_a_missing_tokenization_test/ <br /> ``` <br /> You will then have to answer some questions about the tokenizer for which you want to add tests. The `modelname` should be cased according to the plain text casing, i.e., BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa. Once the command has finished, you should have a one new file inside the newly created folder named `test_tokenization_Xxx.py`. At this point the template is finished and you can move it to the sub-folder of the corresponding model in the test folder.",
        "Adding a new model": "**Adding a new model**<br />This page has been updated in light of the removal of the `add_new_model` script in favor of the more complete `add_new_model_like` script. We recommend you checkout the documentation of [How to add a model](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/add_new_model) in the Hugging Face Transformers documentation for complete and up-to-date instructions.<br />The segmentation appears to be correct as it stands. The first segment introduces the topic of adding a new model, and the second segment provides specific information about the updated process and where to find more detailed instructions. No additional boundaries are needed, and the existing boundaries are appropriately placed to separate the introduction from the detailed instructions.",
        "Prerequisites": "**Operating system**: Windows/Linux/MacOS.<br />**Tools**: Git, Python 3.8+, Node.js (optional).<br />**Additional libraries or dependencies** specified in `requirements.txt`.",
        "Installation": "**Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/example/hypothetical-repo.git`<br />**Navigate to the project folder**: `cd hypothetical-repo`<br />**Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`<br />Optionally, set up environment variables or configuration files for advanced usage.",
        "Post-Installation": "After installation, check the [User Guide](./USER_GUIDE.md) to start using the project.<br />Learn about additional configurations, integrations, and usage examples to make the most of the tool."
