To make it easier for your PR to receive reviews, consider the reviewers will need you to: - Reviewers, the people giving the review, are highly encouraged to revisit the Code of Conduct as well as community expectations and must go above and beyond to promote a collaborative, respectful community.

            "Testing": "Testing is the responsibility of all contributors and is in part owned by all SIGs, but is also coordinated by sig-testing. Refer to the Testing Guide for more information. There are multiple types of tests. The location of the test code varies with type, as do the specifics of the environment needed to successfully run the test: - Unit: These confirm that a particular function behaves as intended. Golang includes a native ability for unit testing via the testing package. Unit test source code can be found adjacent to the corresponding source code within a given package. For example: functions defined in kubernetes/cmd/kubeadm/app/util/version.go will have unit tests in kubernetes/cmd/kubeadm/app/util/version_test.go. These are easily run locally by any developer on any OS. - Integration: These tests cover interactions of package components or interactions between kubernetes components and some other non-kubernetes system resource (eg: etcd). An example would be testing whether a piece of code can correctly store data to or retrieve data from etcd. Integration tests are stored in kubernetes/test/integration/. Running these can require the developer set up additional functionality on their development system. - End-to-end (\"e2e\"): These are broad tests of overall system behavior and coherence. These are more complicated as they require a functional kubernetes cluster built from the sources to be tested. A separate document detailing e2e testing and test cases themselves can be found in kubernetes/test/e2e/. - Conformance: These are a set of testcases, currently a subset of the integration/e2e tests, that the Architecture SIG has approved to define the core set of interoperable features that all Kubernetes deployments must support. For more information on Conformance tests please see the Conformance Testing Document. Continuous integration will run these tests either as pre-submits on PRs, post-submits against master/release branches, or both. The results appear on testgrid. sig-testing is responsible for that official infrastructure and CI. The associated automation is tracked in the test-infra repo. If you're looking to run e2e tests on your own infrastructure, kubetest is the mechanism. Security"

In order to avoid forcing people to be \"at work\" effectively 24/7, we want to establish some semi-formal protocols around development. Hopefully, these rules make things go more smoothly. If you find that this is not the case, please complain loudly. As a potential contributor, your changes and ideas are welcome at any hour of the day or night, weekdays, weekends, and holidays. Please do not ever hesitate to ask a question or send a pull request. Check out our community guiding principles on how to create great code as a big group. Beginner focused information can be found below in Open a Pull Request and Code Review. For quick reference on contributor resources, we have a handy contributor cheatsheet.",

            "Opening a Pull Request": "Opening a Pull Request Pull requests are often called a \"PR\". Kubernetes generally follows the standard github pull request process, but there is a layer of additional kubernetes specific (and sometimes SIG specific) differences: The first difference you'll see is that a bot will begin applying structured labels to your PR. The bot may also make some helpful suggestions for commands to run in your PR to facilitate review. These /command options can be entered in comments to trigger auto-labeling and notifications. Refer to its command reference documentation.",
