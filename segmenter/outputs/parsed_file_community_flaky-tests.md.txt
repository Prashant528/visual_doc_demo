Flaky Tests
Any test that fails occasionally is "flaky". Since our merges only proceed when
all tests are green, and we have a number of different CI systems running the
tests in various combinations, even a small percentage of flakes results in a
lot of pain for people waiting for their PRs to merge.
Therefore, it's important we take flakes seriously. We should avoid flakes by
writing our tests defensively. When flakes are identified, we should prioritize
addressing them, either by fixing them or quarantining them off the critical
path.
The project has a "zero-flake" policy. Test jobs must not automatically retry on test failures.
This was announced and implemented in effect from 2019:
[No more ginkgo.flakeAttempts=2 for e2e tests as of 2019-12-13](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/NNmEGUsJObg/m/dmI2mVc_AAAJ)
(and then confirmed as policy in 2023).

Avoiding Flakes
Write tests defensively. Remember that "almost never" happens all the time when
tests are run thousands of times in a CI environment. Tests need to be tolerant
of other tests running concurrently, resource contention, and things taking
longer than expected.
There is a balance to be had here. Don't log too much, but don't log too little.
Don't assume things will succeed after a fixed delay, but don't wait forever.
THIS IS START BLOCK MARKER.
- Ensure the test functions in parallel with other tests
- Be specific enough to ensure a test isn't thrown off by other tests' assets
- [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/85849](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/85849) - eg: ensure resource name and namespace match

- [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/85967](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/85967) - eg: tolerate errors for non k8s.io APIs

- [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/85619](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/85619) - eg: tolerate multiple storage plugins

- Ensure the test functions in a resource constrained environment
- Only ask for the resources you need
- [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/84975](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/84975) - eg: drop memory constraints for test cases that only need cpu

- Don't use overly tight deadlines (but not overly broad either, non-[Slow] tests timeout after 5min)
- [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/85847](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/85847) - eg: poll for `wait.ForeverTestTimeout` instead of 10s

- [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/84238](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/84238) - eg: poll for 2min instead of 1min

- mark tests as [Slow] if they are unable to pass within 5min

- Do not expect actions to happen instantaneously or after a fixed delay

- Prefer informers and wait loops

- Ensure the test provides sufficient context in logs for forensic debugging
- Explain what the test is doing, eg:
- "creating a foo with invalid configuration"

- "patching the foo to have a bar"

- Explain what specific check failed, and how, eg:
- "failed to create resource foo in namespace bar because of err"

- "expected all items to be deleted, but items foo, bar, and baz remain"

- Explain why a polling loop is failing, eg:
- "expected 3 widgets, found 2, will retry"

- "expected pod to be in state foo, currently in state bar, will retry"

There are significant numbers of flaky tests reported on a regular basis. Fixing
flakes is a quick way to gain expertise and community goodwill.
Expectations when a flaky test is assigned to you
Note that we won't randomly assign these issues to you unless you've opted in or
you're part of a group that has opted in. We are more than happy to accept help
from anyone in fixing these, but due to the severity of the problem when merges
are blocked, we need reasonably quick turn-around time on merge-blocking or
release-blocking flakes. Therefore we have the following guidelines:
- If a flaky test is assigned to you, it's more important than anything else

have such a dispensation, then it's still your responsibility to find new
owners (this may just mean giving stuff back to the relevant Team or SIG Lead).

- You should make a reasonable effort to reproduce it. Somewhere between an

- Once you have made a change that you believe fixes a flake, it is conservative

figure it out from the logs, add log messages that would have help you figure
it out.  If you make changes to make a flake more reproducible, please link
your pull request to the flake you're working on.

- If a flake has been open, could not be reproduced, and has not manifested in

others to reproduce the issue. When filing the issue, use the
[flaking test template](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/new?labels=kind%2Fflake&template=flaking-test.yaml). In

Deflaking unit tests
To get started with deflaking unit tests, you will need to first
reproduce the flaky behavior. Start with a simple attempt to just run
the flaky unit test. For example:

```
go test ./pkg/kubelet/config -run TestInvalidPodFiltered

```

Also make sure that you bypass the `go test` cache by using an uncachable
command line option:

```
go test ./pkg/kubelet/config -count=1 -run TestInvalidPodFiltered

```

If even this is not revealing issues with the flaky test, try running with
[race detection](https://golang.org/doc/articles/race_detector.html) enabled:

```
go test ./pkg/kubelet/config -race -count=1 -run TestInvalidPodFiltered

```

Finally, you can stress test the unit test using the
[stress command](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stress). Install it
with this command:

```
# go version 1.17 and later
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stress@latest

# go version prior to 1.17
go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stress

```

Then build your test binary:

```
go test ./pkg/kubelet/config -race -c

```

Then run it under stress:

```
stress ./config.test -test.run TestInvalidPodFiltered

```

The stress command runs the test binary repeatedly, reporting when it fails. It
will periodically report how many times it has run and how many failures have
occurred.
You should see output like this:

```
411 runs so far, 0 failures
THIS IS START BLOCK MARKER.
/var/folders/7f/9xt_73f12xlby0w362rgk0s400kjgb/T/go-stress-20200825T115041-341977266

THIS IS START BLOCK MARKER.

```
THIS IS END BLOCK MARKER.

Be careful with tests that use the `net/http/httptest` package; they could
exhaust the available ports on your system!
Deflaking integration tests
Integration tests run similarly to unit tests, but they almost always expect a
running `etcd` instance. You should already have `etcd` installed if you have
followed the instructions in the [Development Guide](../development.md). Run
`etcd` in another shell window or tab.
Compile your integration test using a command like this:

```
go test -c -race ./test/integration/endpointslice

```

And then stress test the flaky test using the `stress` command:

```
stress ./endpointslice.test -test.run TestEndpointSliceMirroring

```

For an example of a failing or flaky integration test,
[read this issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/93496#issuecomment-678375312).
Sometimes, but not often, a test will fail due to timeouts caused by
deadlocks. This can be tracked down by stress testing an entire package. The way
to track this down is to stress test individual tests in a package. This process
can take extra effort. Try following these steps:
- Run each test in the package individually to figure out the average runtime.
THIS IS START BLOCK MARKER.

- Stress each test individually, bounding the timeout to 100 times the average run time.

- Isolate the particular test that is deadlocking.

- Add debug output to figure out what is causing the deadlock.
Hopefully this can help narrow down exactly where the deadlock is occurring,

revealing a simple fix!
Deflaking e2e tests
A flaky [end-to-end (e2e) test](e2e-tests.md) offers its own set of
challenges. In particular, these tests are difficult because they test the
entire Kubernetes system. This can be both good and bad. It can be good because
we want the entire system to work when testing, but an e2e test can also fail
because of something completely unrelated, such as failing infrastructure or
misconfigured volumes. Be aware that you can't simply look at the title of an
e2e test to understand exactly what is being tested. If possible, look for unit
and integration tests related to the problem you are trying to solve.
Gathering information
The first step in deflaking an e2e test is to gather information. We capture a
lot of information from e2e test runs, and you can use these artifacts to gather
information as to why a test is failing.
Use the [Prow Status](https://prow.k8s.io/) tool to collect information on
specific test jobs. Drill down into a job and use the Artifacts tab to
collect information. For example, with
[this particular test job](https://prow.k8s.io/view/gcs/kubernetes-jenkins/pr-logs/directory/pull-kubernetes-e2e-gce/1296558932902285312),
we can collect the following:
- `build-log.txt`
THIS IS START BLOCK MARKER.

- In the control plane directory: `artifacts/e2e-171671cb3f-674b9-master/`
- `kube-apiserver-audit.log` (and rotated files)

- `kube-apiserver.log`

- `kube-controller-manager.log`

- `kube-scheduler.log`

- And more!
The `artifacts/` directory will contain much more information. From inside the
THIS IS END BLOCK MARKER.
directories for each node:
- `e2e-171671cb3f-674b9-minion-group-drkr`
THIS IS START BLOCK MARKER.

- `e2e-171671cb3f-674b9-minion-group-lr2z`

- `e2e-171671cb3f-674b9-minion-group-qkkz`
Look for these files:
THIS IS END BLOCK MARKER.
- `kubelet.log`
THIS IS START BLOCK MARKER.

- `docker.log`

- `kube-proxy.log`

- And so forth.
Filtering and correlating information
THIS IS END BLOCK MARKER.
Once you have gathered your information, the next step is to filter and
correlate the information. This can require some familiarity with the issue you are tracking
down, but look first at the relevant components, such as the test log, logs for the API
server, controller manager, and `kubelet`.
Filter the logs to find events that happened around the time of the failure and
events that occurred in related namespaces and objects.
The goal is to collate log entries from all of these different files so you can
get a picture of what was happening in the distributed system. This will help
you figure out exactly where the e2e test is failing. One tool that may help you
with this is [k8s-e2e-log-combiner](https://github.com/brianpursley/k8s-e2e-log-combiner)
Kubernetes has a lot of nested systems, so sometimes log entries can refer to
events happening three levels deep. This means that line numbers in logs might
not refer to where problems and messages originate. Do not make any assumptions
about where messages are initiated!
If you have trouble finding relevant logging information or events, don't be
afraid to add debugging output to the test. For an example of this approach,
[see this issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/88297#issuecomment-588607417).
What to look for
One of the first things to look for is if the test is assuming that something is
running synchronously when it actually runs asynchronously. For example, if the
test is kicking off a goroutine, you might need to add delays to simulate slow
operations and reproduce issues.
Examples of the types of changes you could make to try to force a failure:
- `time.Sleep(time.Second)` at the top of a goroutine
THIS IS START BLOCK MARKER.

- `time.Sleep(time.Second)` at the beginning of a watch event handler

- `time.Sleep(time.Second)` at the end of a watch event handler

- `time.Sleep(time.Second)` at the beginning of a sync loop worker

- `time.Sleep(time.Second)` at the end of a sync loop worker
Sometimes,
THIS IS END BLOCK MARKER.
[such as in this example](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/93496#issuecomment-675631856),
a test might be causing a race condition with the system it is trying to
test. Investigate if the test is conflicting with an asynchronous background
process. To verify the issue, simulate the test losing the race by putting a
`time.Sleep(time.Second)` between test steps.
If a test is assuming that an operation will happen quickly, it might not be
taking into account the configuration of a CI environment. A CI environment will
generally be more resource-constrained and will run multiple tests in
parallel. If it runs in less than a second locally, it could take a few seconds
in a CI environment.
Unless your test is specifically testing performance/timing, don't set tight
timing tolerances. Use `wait.ForeverTestTimeout`, which is a reasonable stand-in
for operations that should not take very long. This is a better approach than
polling for 1 to 10 seconds.
Is the test incorrectly assuming deterministic output? Remember that map iteration in go is
non-deterministic. If there is a list being compiled or a set of steps are being
performed by iterating over a map, they will not be completed in a predictable
order. Make sure the test is able to tolerate any order in a map.
Be aware that if a test is mixing random allocation with static allocation, that
there will be intermittent conflicts.
Finally, if you are using a fake client with a watcher, it can relist/rewatch at any point.
It is better to look for specific actions in the fake client rather than
asserting exact content of the full set.THIS IS END BLOCK MARKER.
