I want you to create the following two JSONs from the list: 1. JSON name = 'content'. Description: For each element in the list, I want to map the topic of the element to the content of the element. Extract one topic from the content and keep the content as it is provided . This json would be named 'content' and an example looks like: { 'Topic 1': 'content 1', 'Topic 2': 'content 2', 'Topic 3': 'content 3'}. 2. JSON name = 'flow'.Description: For all the elements in the list, I want to find the sequence that a person contributing to that project would follow in a practical scenario. If each element in the list was a node in a graph, I want a JSON that gives me a source node and the target node for each edge in the graph. The format of the JSON should look like { 'edges': [ {'source': 'Topic 1', 'target': 'Topic 2'}, {'source': 'Topic 2', 'target': 'Topic 3'} ] }. Please make sure that the first 'source' node for each flow is always a dummy node named 'Parent Node'. Finally, merge the two JSONs into a single one that looks like: {content: '...', flow:'...'}."
