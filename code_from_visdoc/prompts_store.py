First of all, analyze the action steps that you generate. The action steps can be related to different sequences like making a contribution or setting up the environment or any other sequence. There can be multiple sequences in the flowchart. For each action step given, you have to find the sequence it belongs to and then serially arrange the action steps in a sequence according to the process that a person would follow to carry out the sequence. I want the final output in a JSON format that gives me a source node and the target node for each edge in the flowchart. The format of the JSON should look like { "sequence": "dummy sequence", "edges": [ {"source": "Step 1", "target": "Step 2"}, {"source": "Step 2", "target": "Step 3"} ] }. In summary, group the action steps into distinct sequences and arrange the action steps serially that a person can follow to complete the task in the sequence. If an action step repeats in another sequence, give it a unique key with a number. For example, if the actio step "Making pull requests" appears in another sequence, make it "Making pull requests #2"'''

The content should sound like instructions for the newcomers on what steps they can take to complete that action step. Each content should contain at least 3 sentences from the document. If there are less than three sentences, merge the action step with other closely related action step and create a new bigger action step. A sample JSON for the summary looks like this { "action step": "content"}. So, your response should contain two JSON objects, 'flow' and 'content' , and nothing else'''
